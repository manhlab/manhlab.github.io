title: Important Conferences
abstract: I'm still exploring what it means to be a researcher. Here I'll take a look at conferences, which play an important role in my field. I'll also provide a timeline of the most important MACHINE/DEEP LEARNING, ROBOTICS, COMPUTER VISION and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE conferences including paper submission deadlines.

# {{ page.title }}

Now that I’m a PhD candidate, I need to do real research. Come to think of it, it’s really quite amazing that one can make a living by exploring reality in my opinion. I also need to publish my research so it can get peer-reviewed and added to the great knowledge pool of humanity.

In machine learning and robotics, contrary to the long-established sciences like physics and biology, the most prestigious place to publish your research are conferences (or rather conference proceedings[^2]) rather than journals like _Nature_ and _Science_. In this article, I want to take a look at the most important of those conferences[^1], both as a reference and to learn more about this new world I’m currently discovering. But first, let’s have a look at what a (academic) conference even is:

> An academic conference or scientific conference (also: symposium, workshop, meeting, etc.) is an event for researchers (not necessarily academics) to present and discuss their work. Together with academic or scientific journals and Eprint archives such as arXiv, conferences provide an important channel for exchange of information between researchers. – Wikipedia

Most conferences consist of a number of presentations, highlighting the key insights from a previously submitted and accepted paper, followed by discussions. There can also be so called _keynote speakers_ who establish the underlying theme of the conference. Further, workshops can be part of a conference, allowing for a more hands on approach to the presented topic. They have their own format for paper submission, often with a lower barrier for acceptance. Conferences featuring both talks and workshops are called _double-track_.

[^1]: There will be a strong selection bias towards my own interests.
[^2]: _“In academia […] [a] conference proceeding is a collection of academic papers published in the context of an academic conference or workshop.”_ – Wikipedia

## Conference Timeline[^3]
[^3]: Almost all conferences taking place in 2020 will be postponed or held virtually due to Covid-19.

### February 7 - 12: AAAI
#### Paper submission deadline: September 5
*Acceptance rate: 25.7%[^aaai]*

[^aaai]: Average 2012 - 2020

The conference of the _Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence_ is the primary conference on AI together with [IJCAI](#july-11---17-ijcai). The 34th of it's kind took place in New York from February 7th to 12th.

> The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in artificial intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers in AI and its affiliated disciplines.

It _"welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence"_ such as "_search, planning, knowledge representation, reasoning, natural language processing, robotics and perception, multiagent systems, statistical learning, and deep learning_".

It has been held almost annually starting from 1980 in California and subsequently moved through most of the US, though never outside of it.

### April 26 - May 1: ICLR
#### Paper submission deadline: September 25
*Acceptance rate: 33.3%[^iclr]*

[^iclr]: Average 2017 - 2020

The _International Conference on Learning Representations_ is a double-track annual conference on machine and deep learning. It describes itself as _"the premier gathering of professionals dedicated to the advancement of the branch of artificial intelligence called representation learning, but generally referred to as deep learning."_ Though it has to share this spot with [ICML](#july-12-18-icml) and [NeurIPS](#december-5-12-neurips-aka-nips). In 2020 it was supposed to take place in Addis Ababa, Ethopia but had to be moved online due to COVID-19.

> ICLR is globally renowned for presenting and publishing cutting-edge research on all aspects of deep learning used in the fields of artificial intelligence, statistics and data science, as well as important application areas such as machine vision, computational biology, speech recognition, text understanding, gaming, and robotics.

Since its inception in 2013 in the US it has been held in Canada, Puerto Rico and France.

### July 11 - 17: IJCAI
#### Paper submission deadline: January 21
*Acceptance rate: 22.5%[^ijcai]*

[^ijcai]: Average 2013 - 2020

The _International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence_ shares it's place as most prestigious conference on AI with the [AAAI](#february-7---12-aaai). It's 29th incarnation takes place in Yokohama (Japan) on July 11th to 17th.

The goal of the IJCAI is the _"dissemination of information on Artificial Intelligence"_ and of _"cutting-edge scientific results"_. Judging from the accepted papers of 2020, AI still mostly means machine learning though. With an average acceptance rate of 22.5%, declining from 20.5% in 2018 to only 12.6% in 2020, it is probably the most selective conference in this list and even more selective than some highly ranked journals.

While it was only held every other year from 1969--it's date of birth--till 2015, it has since been held annually in various countries like Japan, Canada and Italy.

### August 3-6: UAI
#### Paper submission deadline: February 20

*Acceptance rate: 30.8%[^uai]*

[^uai]: Average 2014 - 2019

_"The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is one of the premier international conferences on research related to knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning in the presence of uncertainty."_ It will take place from August 3rd to 6th in Toronto (Canada) in its 36th incarnation.

This topic is dear to me, as I've been working on it for my Masters thesis, but its also likely the next big thing in deep learning. As learning systems are being deployed more and more in the real world, they have to cope with its inherent unpredictability.

First held in 1985 in the US, it later moved to Canada, Sweden, Mexico, Scotland, Finland, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia and Israel.

*Acceptance rate: <30%[^corl]*

[^corl]: There is only limited data available yet for this conference due to its youth.

The _Conference on Robot Learning_ is a young annual international conference aiming at becoming the top venue for robot learning research. In 2020 it will be held entirely virtually from November 16th to 18th due to COVID-19.

The focus lies _"on the intersection of robotics and machine learning. [...] CoRL is a selective, single-track conference for robot learning research, covering a broad range of topics spanning robotics, ML [Machine Learning] and control, and including theory and applications. [...] Authors are strongly encouraged to demonstrate how their methods relate to robotics and applications."_

### December 5-12: NeurIPS (aka NIPS)
#### Paper submission deadline: June 5
*Acceptance rate: 24.8%*

The _Neural Information Processing Systems_ conference is one of the most, if not _the_ most prestigious conference for machine learning. This year (2020) it comes in its 34th incarnation and will take place in December 5th through 12th at the Vancouver Convention Center.

It was first proposed in 1986 by _The California Institute of Technology_ and the infamous _Bell Laboratories_ and was an invitation only event. It was introduced as an interdisciplinary approach to biological and artificial neural networks though nowadays the latter is certainly much more prominent with a strong focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.

Born in Snowbird, Utah (USA) it has since been held in Denver (USA), Vancouver (Canada), Granada (Spain), Lake Tahoe (USA), Montreal (Canada), Barcelona (Spain) and Long Beach (USA).
