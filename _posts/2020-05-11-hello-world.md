Hello! You are reading my first, rather uninspirational, blog post. I've been toying with the idea of a personal blog for about a year now and finally found the time and courage to do it. While this is a personal blog, you most likely won't find any posts about me, but rather about interesting stuff I've learned which I'd like to share in a visually pleasing and easy to understand way. Topics might range from machine learning (where I'm trying to get a PhD) to baking, bikes and building things.

Well, still got a little personal right there! I'll try to have at least one post a month, though this is rather a promise to myself than to you, dear reader. Hope to see you (and me) around soon.

Best,<br>
Matthias.
